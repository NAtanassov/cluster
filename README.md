The ultimate goal is to have the whole infrastructure as a file or set of files. Then on top of it to create an automated build process which upon a change in the projectâ€™s files will trigger a build and application update. The change notification can be either triggered by the source control system or as a result from a regular check on every five minutes initiated by the CD/CI system.
